# cine-bs-plugin
This plugin is meant to be used with movian and integrates the streaming services of cine.to to the movian platform.

This plugin is meant to be used as is with no warranty what so ever. If you face problems you're free to name them.
As this plugin was initially only meant for personal usage, bug fixes and additional features will only be implemented if theres time and motivation.

# Functions so far:
* Browse - Browse through movies (by genre)
* Search - Lets you search for a specific movie
* (due to the limited GUI capabilities of movian, the filters as implemented on the page (rating, year...) are omitted to keep it clean and easy)
